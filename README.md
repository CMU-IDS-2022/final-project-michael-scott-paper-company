## Work distribution

While writing the proposal for the project, we did some preprocessing on the data to analyze the feasibility of our planned visualizations. We iteratively improved on this plan based on the current state of the project, and the quality of the data. During the implementation phase, we split up the work into tasks of data preprocessing, machine learning and data visualization tasks. After this, we took up tasks equally, and while we mostly worked on our parts of the project, we collaborated to finalize the project and to debug any issues. 

## Deliverables

### Proposal

- [x] The URL at the top of this readme needs to point to your application online. It should also list the names of the team members.
- [x] A completed [proposal](Proposal.md). Each student should submit the URL that points to this file in their github repo on Canvas.

### Sketches

- [x] Develop sketches/prototype of your project.

### Final deliverables

- [x] All code for the project should be in the repo.
- [x] Update the **Online URL** above to point to your deployed project.
- [x] A detailed [project report](Report.md).  Each student should submit the URL that points to this file in their github repo on Canvas.
- [x] A 5 minute video demonstration.  Upload the video to this github repo and link to it from your report.

### Abstract

Climate change is a global problem that affects all walks of life and is a pressing issue that needs to be addressed collectively by us. There are several factors that contribute to it and each of them to different extents. Given the widespread impact of climate change, it is important to analyze the major contributing factors and the effect. In this project, we attempt to craft a data-driven story using visualizations and interactions on climate change, its causes and some projections for the future based on current trends. We plan to look at this problem at two levels: at a country level - whether the economic status, the level of industrialization etc of a country directly correlates with how much it contributes to climate change and also at a global level - the relative amounts to which different countries and regions are impacted by climate change. In addition to this, we also use projections of temperature into the future and develop a model to predict the extent of Arctic Sea ice sheets and visualize them.
